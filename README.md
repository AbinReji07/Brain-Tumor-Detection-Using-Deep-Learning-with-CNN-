# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-with-CNN-
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model classifies scans as tumor or no tumor using image features. It enables fast, accurate, and non-invasive diagnosis, supporting medical professionals in early detection and treatment planning.
